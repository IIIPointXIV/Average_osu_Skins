<h1 align="center">Average your osu skins!</h1>
<br>

#### Warning! Still a wip so may not work as intended. Should be good enough for a few skins though.

<br>

# Features
- Gobbles up your RAM if you have too many skins. The more you add the more it gobbles!
- Average your osu skins. [(example)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IIIPointXIV/Average_osu_Skins/main/Images/selection-mode2x%20example.png)
- Takes forever to run! The worse your computer is and the more skins you have the longer it takes!
- Sometimes the finished skin is just broken! So much fun!

# How to use
1. Download and unzip the latest release.
2. Launch the .exe
3. It should get the location of osu automatically. If it doesn't let me know.
4. Set how many threads it will use (I recommend one less than the amount you have)
5. Set any other settings
6. Click the "Make Avberage Skin" button!
7. Wait 7 years for it to finish! It will update you along the way
